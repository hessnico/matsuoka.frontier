Description: This package implements a deterministic production frontier model based on the three-step estimation approach described in "A Three-Step Approach to Production Frontier Estimation and the Matsuokaâ€™s Distribution". It provides tools for estimating the production frontier, evaluating efficiency, and visualizing results. Various methods for nonparametric regression estimation of the production function are supported, including local linear regression and spline approaches.
